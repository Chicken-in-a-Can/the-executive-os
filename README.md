# BossOS
**BossOS** rewrite. KDE Plasma is now used due to it being easier to use and better looking than XFCE. Build and install scripts now actually work. Now based on Arch even though Fedora is better.

## How to Use
To use BossOS, you have to build it yourself.
```console
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Chicken-in-a-Can/the-executive-os
# cd into cloned repo
cd the-executive-os
# build the OS, enter sudo passwd when prompted
./build
# install the OS, enter sudo passwd when prompted
./install
```
We will try to set up some HTTP mirrors on our website so you can download it, but this may take some time.
