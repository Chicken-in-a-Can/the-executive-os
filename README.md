# BossOS
**BossOS** rewrite. Using KDE Plasma now, cause it looks better than XFCE. And making good build and install scripts, so that it's better. Whole thing's Arch-based, cause it's superior  

## How to Use
To use BossOS, you have to built it yourself
```console
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Chicken-in-a-Can/the-executive-os
# cd into cloned repo
cd the-executive-os
# build the OS, enter sudo passwd when prompted
./build
# install the OS, enter sudo passwd when prompted
./install
```
We'll try to get some http mirrors set up on our website so you can download it, but may take a bit
