# BossOS
**BossOS** rewrite. Using KDE Plasma now, cause it looks better than XFCE. And making good build and install scripts, so that it's better. Whole thing's Arch-based, cause it's superior  

## How to Use
To use BossOS, you have to built it yourself, run `./build`  
To install on a flash drive, run  `./install`  
We'll try to get some http mirrors set up on our website so you can download it, but may take a bit
